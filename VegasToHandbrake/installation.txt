How to use Vegas2HandBrake in Vegas Pro

Put clip(s) into the Vegas Pro timeline. Edit your Vegas project. 
Before you start encoding, you should know that the frameserver has a bug that makes audio faulty at the last second. To correct this, tick "Add 1-second buffer before rendering" in preferences to automatically add a buffer of exactly 1 second length at the end of your project(and auto-delete it afterwards). 
In the toolbar click the symbol "Send2HandBrake" and wait until HandBrake opens and scans the input video. 
In HandBrake do all the adjustments necessary for the AVC encoding, start rendering and wait until HandBrake automatically quits after it finished rendering.

If you set a loop-region in the Vegas timeline this process will automatically use only the timeline section of your loop-region for encoding. So before starting the Vegas2HandBrake process always take care of the loop-region.

If this automation process will be interrupted ¨C intentionally or not ¨C in Vegas Pro quit the frameserver process manually, then in the toolbar click the icon "preferences" and click "unmount" button in the popup window.
